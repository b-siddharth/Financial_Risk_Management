Applying Machine Learning To Financial Risk Management Using IBM Watson

  Financial institutions must consistently evaluate the perils associated with their transactions, meticulously assessing their risk levels through the refined practice of credit scoring. In the lead-up to the infamous financial crisis of 2008-09, nearly all prominent banks relied on credit scoring models grounded in statistical theories. Alas, the reverberations of that crisis, which primarily stemmed from the grievous underestimation of risk, illuminated the imperative for heightened precision in scoring methodologies. This pressing demand, coupled with escalating prerequisites and the advent of cutting-edge technologies, has ushered in a transformative epoch: the advent of credit scoring underpinned by the intricate mechanisms of machine learning.

  This project entails the construction of a financial risk control model through the utilization of machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to supplant the conventional manual process of scrutinizing loan applications. By doing so, the model enhances the review process in terms of swiftness, precision, and approval rates. Furthermore, the project incorporates the application of a Random Forest Classifier algorithm to devise a loan user scorecard system that adeptly captures alterations in user data, surpassing the capabilities of prevailing credit card systems employed by financial institutions. Additionally, the project delves into the exploration of challenges related to data imbalance and performance enhancement, seeking to address these crucial aspects.
